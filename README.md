# NPRP

NPRP is a Non-photorealistic Render Pipeline for Unity Engine. It is modeled after Unity Technology's Universal Render Pipeline but favors non-photorealistic visuals.

> Its predecessors were some toon shaders under URP. You can get the source code [here](https://github.com/flicker-studio/NPRP/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha).
